# SampleSpace

### By Robbie Neville

SampleSpace is a two-sided marketplace implemented with
Ruby On Rails that enables users to upload and share audio
samples for use in music production. I undertook this project
as an assessment piece whilst studying a Web dev bootcamp
with Coder Academy, in 2022. It needs a lot of work, but,
as my first Rails project, I'm proud of what I managed to
achieve!

## Controller Comments

The assessment rubric required comments that demonstrated
our knowledge of the database queries that were being
performed by ActiveRecord model methods. So, there's
plenty of that in the controllers.

## Dependencies

**Ruby version**: 2.7.1

**Rails version**: ~> 6.1.6

## Installation & Usage

Clone the repo and run:

```
bundle install

```

in the project's root directory.

After the installation process is complete, run the following two commands in the project's root directory:

```
rails db:migrate
rails action_text:install
```

When they have completed, you can start the application by issueing `rails s` (in the project's root directory).
